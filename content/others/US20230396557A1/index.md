abstract: Example methods and systems for policy-aware traffic forwarding for multiple types of network traffic are described. In one example, a computer system may extract identification information associated with a first client, wherein the first client is associated with a first type of network traffic and obtain a first policy associated with the first client. In response to detecting first network traffic of the first type from the first client, the computer system may (a) interwork the first network traffic into a data plane entity associated with the second type of network traffic, and (b) forward the first network traffic via the data plane entity according to the first policy. In response to detecting second network traffic of the second type from a second client, the computer system may forward the second network traffic via the data plane entity according to a second policy associated with the second client.
