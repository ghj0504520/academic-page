abstract: Service function chain (SFC) deployment is to embed virtualized network function (VNF) instances into a cloud-based infrastructure and chain them in sequence to provide a specific network service. Many approaches have been proposed for SFC deployments with diverse objectives. However, no SFC deployment approach factors in the embodied and operational carbon emissions, which are complicated by location- and time-varying carbon intensity (CI) and the amortization of carbon footprint among SFCs when they share VNF instances and communication links. Moreover, prioritizing lower carbon emissions for an SFC might degrade its end-to-end latency and vice versa. This work aims to jointly minimize carbon emissions and latency in SFC deployment, factoring in 1) SFC lifetime, traffic rates, and resource usage, 2) amortized embodied and operational carbon emissions, and 3) processing and propagation delay. We propose a rule to amortize the carbon footprint to SFCs and an SFC deployment algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a time-series forecasting method to predict spatial and temporal fluctuations of CIs. Simulations based on real-world historical CI data and dynamic SFC arrivals and departures confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
