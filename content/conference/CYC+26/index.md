abstract: Collaborative edge-cloud computing is an emerging paradigm that balances processing efficiency and user experience by offloading edge workloads to the cloud (i.e., vertical offload- ing). Adding the option of horizontal offloading (i.e., edge-to-edge offloading) can further enhance the flexibility of this architecture. However, prior work ignored temporal and spatial variations in carbon emissions when making offloading decisions. Our study aims to jointly optimize the carbon footprint and the balance of edge servers’ workloads, which is challenged by dynamic workload arrivals to edge servers and time-and-location-varying carbon intensity (CI). We propose an online algorithm Lyapunov optimization framework to configure offloading workload and transmission power for mixed vertical and horizontal offloading. Simulations based on historical CI data reveal that the proposed algorithm can efficiently reduce carbon footprint while balancing queue backlogs among edge and cloud servers.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
